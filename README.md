### About the challenge
This reposotory stores all the code I developed for the challenge problems given during the 21 day coding challenge presented by <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/" target="_blank">Lighthouse Labs</a>

The challenge is to code a simple problem everyday for 21 days straight. This to help build on Javascript skills and possibly compete for prizes that can be won!   

### Why I took on this challenge?

I decided to take on this challenge as it is a fun way to develop my Javascript skills. These simple problems can help keep my mind pointed torwards Javascript and continue supporting my basic skills. I am also using this challenge as a way to continue develop on my ES6 skills. I predominantly code in ES5 and want to shift to using ES6 syntaxes. This wat, I can stay up to date with future development.
